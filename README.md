## ‚öôÔ∏è Database Setup

1. **Create a MySQL Database**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE feed_app;
USE feed_app;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following database credentials:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=<db_pwd>
DB_DATABASE=<db_name>
```

Make sure to replace `<db_pwd>` with your actual database password and `<db_name>` with the database name.
